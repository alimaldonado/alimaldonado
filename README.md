### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ali
<p>
            And I'm a Web Developer with 2+ years of experience, developing the
            backend for steady enterprise level applications. I love working
            with SQL databases, APIs and server-side code.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal everyday is delivering not only high quality code, but
            useful solutions for each purpose.
          </p>
